TODO list for WMNUT
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note: WMNut is no more evolving, though still maintained. This means that
the TODO list items below will probably never get implemented.

Planned for 0.80.0
	* Status overview (9 R/G/B/none LED) between arrows and panel

Planned for 0.90.0
	* Page 0 dedicated as a "launcher" page (to call wmnut configuration
		GUI, or external application)

Planned for 0.95.0
	* wmnut configuration GUI to ease user configuration,

Planned for 1.0.0
	* Above and below features, no bugs and no user request pending.

Not scheduled yet or backgrounded:

	* autoconf for getopt: EOF (Solaris) vs. -1 (HP-UX, AIX)
	* Derive a gkrellm applet (or include an option)
	* Validate and enhance other platforms support (FreeBSD,
	  NetBSD, Solaris and other NUT supported platforms),
	  and other window managers support
	* Add an option to choose between battery load in bargraph
	  or with a battery (asapm style)
	or Themability (skins !)
	* Nice logo.
	* Background color option
	* Enlarge border in windowed mode to facilitate window moving
	* consider creating /var/run/wmnut.pid (for fixing multi instance pb)
	* Add setitimer to flush_expose() to deal with no X11 events

Abandoned features
	* Derive a gnome / kde applet (or include an option). This is part
		of other projects.
	* dynamically reread rcfiles files on SIGUSR1


Your feedback is greatly appreciated! If you have nice suggestions, ideas,
code, patches, whatever, that aren't on this list, feel free to post them
to https://github.com/networkupstools/wmnut/issues

If you don't let us know... how are we supposed to know? ;-)
